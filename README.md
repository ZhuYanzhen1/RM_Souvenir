# RM_Souvenir
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0.3-brightgreen.svg)&nbsp;&nbsp;![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/Build-Passed-success.svg)&nbsp;&nbsp;![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This repository stores the secondary development code for the RM souvenir. The badge as a whole is in the shape of a disc, divided into six different blocks, representing the six different themes of the six years of Robomaster themed summer camps from 2017 to 2022, which when put together form a complete disc, representing the tireless efforts of RM summer camps over the past six years and the hard work of each assistant coach in each year.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badge as a whole adopts the classic red and blue color scheme of RM that echoes each other. A few red elements are consciously added to the blue-based blocks, and the same is done in the red blocks, forming a kind of echo of the red and blue blocks and ensuring the integrity of the design. The black and white colors are introduced as embellishments to the rhythm of the picture, making the whole more durable.
